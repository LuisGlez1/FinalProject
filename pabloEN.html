                    <div class="text">Pablo Delgado</div>
                    <span>Head Developer</span>
                    <p>Pablo is the leading technological partner in toolip. As a Computing student at Carlos III University in Madrid, as well as having 3 years of work experience in a big tech firm, he has the perfect set of skills to provide our clients with some of the best technological services. He has lead and been involved in multiple projects regarding cybersecurity, blockchain, artificial intelligence and big data. He understands how tech firms need to function to be successful, making him the perfect candidate for the role of CTO.</p>
                    <p>One of his greatest personal motivators is that of tech innovation. Apart from being the principal developer of the solutions we provide to our clients, he plans ahead and stays informed about new technologies and techniques that could empower our products and better our help for our clients.</p>
                    <p>If there is one thing that characterizes Pablo it's his determination and his willingness to put as much effort as needed to solve a problem. This comes from his natural passion for critical thinking and from the abilities he has gained over the years not only through his work but also through personal projects from tools such as HackerRank and Project Euler. His capabilities are essential to empower and expand the range of projects we can take on and give us confidence that no matter the problem our clients are faced with, we will be able to develop a solution.</p>
